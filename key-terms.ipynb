    "# TDM Key Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Programming Interface (API) <a id=\"api\"></a>\n",
    "A protocol that defines communication between a client and server, often used to request data. APIs can help retrieve data from remote repositories, anything from weather to Twitter and Facebook. \n",
    "## Artificial Intelligence <a id=\"artificial-intelligence\"></a>\n",
    "The science of making intelligent machines, especially machines that react to input data in a way similar to a human being. Historically, artificial intelligence has tended to rely on simple if-then statements (e.g. if the user mentions their mother, ask how she is doing), but recent advancements in artificial intelligence have focused on [machine learning](#machine-learning): the ability of machines to rewrite their own algorithms to improve their accuracy.\n",
    "## Bag of Words (Model) <a id =\"bag-of-words\"></a>\n",
    "A model of texts that counts individual words without regard to grammatical location or phrases. Just as the letters of a Scrabble game are tossed into a bag without order, a \"bag of words\" model gathers all the words of a text into a \"bag\" with no regard to where a particular word occurs within the document. In this model, the reader knows every word and its frequency within the text but does not have the context of the word's use.\n",
    "## Bibliographic Metadata <a id=\"bibliographic-metadata\"></a>\n",
    "Also known as \"descriptive metadata,\" informational [metadata](#metadata) that describes a published item such as a book or journal article.  Bibliographic metadata contains data elements to help users identify and retrieve the published items.   It often has a formalized bibliographic format.\n",
    "## Bigram <a id=\"bigram\"></a>\n",
    "An [n-gram](#n-gram) with a length of two. For example, \"chicken stock\" is a word bigram.\n",
    "## Bayesian Classification\n",
    "A classification method based on [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) that describes the probability of an event based on available prior knowledge. For example, given a dataset of the historical weather conditions (temperature, humidity, windspeed) from December 25th for every year over the last century, will it snow on December 25th, 2027?\n",
    "## Clean Data<a id=\"clean-data\"></a>\n",
    "Data that has been standardized and corrected for accurate results. This phrase can also be used as a verb such as \"to clean data\" or \"cleaning data.\" In practice, data cleaning makes up the bulk of text analysis work. \n",
    "## Clustering\n",
    "## Collocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concordance\n",
    "## Content Words <a id=\"content-words\"></a>\n",
    "As opposed to [function words](#function-words) (e.g. articles, pronouns, conjuctions), content words (e.g. nouns, verbs, and adjectives) carry greater lexical meaning. Word frequency analysis typically attempts to filter out function words, in order to make content words more prominent. This filtering is accomplished with a [stop words](#stop-words) list.\n",
    "## Corpus <a id=\"corpus\"></a>\n",
    "A large (and often structured) collection of texts used for analysis. For example, all of the plays written by Shakespeare. A simple example might be a set of plain text files in a folder on your computer. A more complicated example may use [JSON](#json), [XML](#xml), or another form of markup, to allow for deeper analysis. The plural form is corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also [TEI XML](#tei-xml). \n",
    "## Counter (in Python) <a id=\"python-counter\"></a>\n",
    "A data type similar to a [Python dictionary](#python-dictionary) with a few key differences:\n",
    "* A counter object with a value of zero or less, always returns 0\n",
    "* When a key is called that doesn't exist in the counter, it returns 0 instead of an error like in a dictionary\n",
    "* A counter object has additional methods for counting including `.most_common(x)` that returns the x most common values.\n",
    "* Counter objects can be added, subtracted, as well as being modified through unions (&) and intersections (|)\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV (file) <a id=\"csv-file\"></a>\n",
    "A .csv file, or Comma-Separated Value file, is a simple format for storing structured data where each entry in the file is separated by a comma. Similarly, a [TSV file](#tsv-file) uses tabs to separate individual data entries. \n",
    "## Dataframe (in [Pandas](#pandas)) <a id=\"pandas-dataframe\"></a>\n",
    "The primary data structure for analysis, manipulation, and presentation of data with the [Pandas library](#pandas).\n",
    "## Dataset <a id=\"dataset\"></a>\n",
    "A collection of information, usually computer files, used for statistical analysis. Most datasets are digital text (either numbers, words, or both), but they can also be other formats such as image, audio, and/or video content. Datasets are usually referred to as structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.\n",
    "Structured data fits into a predetermined format and can usually be represented by a table, spreadsheet, or relational database. \n",
    "Unstructured data is more freeform. For example, longform texts, audio, or video content are unstructured. \n",
    "Semi-structured data uses tags or elements to mark out structures within an unstructured data set. Email files, for example, have both structured aspects (Sender, Subject, etc.), but the body of an email is usually unstructured.\n",
    "## Dataset ID <a id=\"dataset-id\"></a>\n",
    "A unique identifier for a [dataset](#dataset) created using the [corpus](#corpus) builder. A copy of your dataset ID will be sent to you in an email.\n",
    "## Descriptive Metadata <a id=\"descriptive-metadata\"></a>\n",
    "See [bibliographic metadata](#bibliographic-metadata).\n",
    "## Dictionary (Python) <a id=\"python-dictionary\"></a>\n",
    "A variable in [Python](#python) that stores data in [key/value pairs](#key-value-pair). This differs from a [Python](#python) [list](#python-list) which stores data in numberical order beginning with item 0.\n",
    "## Discipline\n",
    "An academic field or body of knowledge taught and studied within colleges or universities. Generally academic disciplines are divided into three large groups: \n",
    "* The Humanities include disciplines like English, History, Law\n",
    "* The Sciences include disciplines like Physics, Biology, Mathematics\n",
    "* The Social Sciences include include disciplines like Anthropology, Economics, and Sociology\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic disciplines as divisions are matters of convenience for organizing departments, but many, if not most, professors research in two or more disciplines at a time. \n",

    "Short for (eXtensible markup language), XML uses tags to identify parts of a document for a machine to understand. Like HTML, these tags have an opening tag (e.g. <l>) and a closing tag marked by a forward slash (e.g. </l>). Unlike HTML, these tags can be freely created according to whatever standard the creator needs. One prominent example is the [Text Encoding Initiative](https://tei-c.org/). The example below uses [TEI-XML](#tei-xml) to describe Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 by labeling lines, quatrains, and the final couplet. This kind of markup enables computers to do complex analysis quickly such as comparing every couplet, quatrain, or line in Shakespeare's sonnets.\n",
