# Creating your own Jupyter Book Website for Teaching
The [official Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) has more details about the platform. This tutorial is intended to help teachers get a course website up and running quickly for teaching. This tutorial will help you create a class website using free hosting from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See the GitHub Pages documentation for details about using a custom domain and other possibilities.

## Create a GitHub Account

Click "Sign up" and supply a username, email address, and password for your account.

Verify your email address with GitHub by clicking the "Verify Email Address" button sent to your email.

## Fork the Constellate Notebooks repository

Visit the [Constellate notebooks repository](https://github.com/ithaka/tdm-notebooks). In the upper right-hand corner click on "Fork".

In the repository, click on "Settings" and rename the repository to your course name. Then click "Rename".

## GitHub Pages Settings

Navigate back into "Settings" then scroll down the page to "GitHub Pages". Check that the source is the branch "gh-pages" and the folder is "/(root)". If necessary, click the "Save" button. (This is also where you can find settings for a custom domain if you own one you would like to use.)

## View your Site

It may take 1-2 minutes for GitHub to load your settings. When your site is ready, it will be available at the site: https://**your-github-username**.github.io/**your-repository-name**/ 

If you navigate back to "Settings > GitHub Pages", a link to your site will be supplied.
