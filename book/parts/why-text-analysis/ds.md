# Why should data scientists and business professionals learn text analysis?

You may have heard buzz in the business world about text analysis, artificial intelligence, or big data. But if you're skilling up to advance your career or to solve an existing company problem, it is not obvious why text analysis matters. Many businesses operate without data science insights from text analysis (and we all know a few businesses likely to continue for decades more), but there is no doubt that interest in text analysis for business insights is growing. How can learning text analysis give you an edge?

## Data literacy is at the heart of business research

Twenty years ago, the data available for business insights could be handled by a few specialized individuals. Today, it is clear that digital data is *the main record*, not just for businesses, but for all of human society. Even small businesses often have more data than they have the expertise to understand and put to use. The ability to search, manipulate, clean, and connect digital records has become essential for informing decisions from the C-suite to middle management. While we often think of business insights coming from numerical data, the vast majority of data in any business is actually unstructured, text data including internal email, user feedback, social media, and transaction data. The opportunity for business insights from textual data are enormous, but only for people who can find and connect the most relevant information from an ocean of data.


## Data skills are in demand

One job has consistently topped Glassdoor's list of best jobs in recent years (2016-2019): data scientist. Data skills are in-demand because all businesses have data, but not all have the skills to find the insights in their data. Key insights increasingly come from textual data. Companies need experts who can extract the sentiment from customer service calls, gather customer demographic or location data from social media, build bots that assist user support, or redact sensitive information from internal research. The business applications of text analysis surround us every day. Text analysis is behind the auto-suggest on your phone, it filters the spam out of your email, it helps suggest movies for you on Netflix. In this information age, with the onset of "big data," text analysis helps us read, interpret, and act on data at enterprise scales.

For businesses that have significant data, the primary advantage that text mining offers is an ability to drive (and in some cases, automate) key business decisions based on insights from large-scale, unstructured textual data. While numerical data remains the most compelling and tractable form of business data, almost all businesses have significant bodies of textual data that sit dormant, in part, because no one on staff possesses the skills to unlock their potential.

## Leveraging business data to help your customers

If your business is of a certain size, you're certainly gathering data on your customers and users. Maybe you have some text data that is structured (or data you *wish* was structured) in the form of customer names, addresses, email addresses, or past purchases. Text analysis can help turn unstructured data into structured data, but it can also help make unstructured textual data tractable and actionable. Consider the data your company has.

-   Do you collect written feedback from customers?
-   Do you offer customer service or call-center help?
-   Do your products have written documentation?
-   Does your marketing team interact with social media?
-   Does your business use email? (In 2019, 188 million emails were sent every minute!)

## How difficult is text analysis to learn?

For many, text analysis sounds *potentially* powerful and useful, but the reality remains that learning text analysis is not a trivial task. To become proficient, you'll have to learn a programming language like Python or R. If you're not doing formal coursework in linguistics or computer science, it may feel like getting started is impossible. That's as true for students as it is for professors and librarians. The good news is that programming and text analysis, like any skills, can be learned to a greater or lesser degree. Mastering a language can take many years, but you don't need to master programming to get started.

If you want to do international business, it is very helpful to speak a second language. Still, there are plenty of successful business people that never learn a second language (or learn just enough to navigate local resources significant to their business interests). You don't need to know everything about Python or everything about text analysis. You just need to learn enough to leverage the data your company has available.

## How long will it take me to learn text analysis?

The answer to, "How long will it take me to learn text analysis?" depends on the skills you want to learn. 

Instead of trying to learn everything, you should focus on the things likely to be beneficial given the data you have access to. To get started, you need to understand the possible applications for text analysis, so you are in a good position to decide what to learn (and how much). Even if you have no programming experience, it is reasonable to expect you could be doing beginner-level text analysis methods in a few weeks and intermediate-level text analysis methods in a month.

Let's consider a few methods that could help any business.
