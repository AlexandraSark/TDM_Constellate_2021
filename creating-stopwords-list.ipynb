    "# The Purpose of a Stopwords List\n",
    "\n",
    "Many text analytics techniques are based on counting the occurrence of words in a given text or set of texts (called a corpus). The most frequent words can reveal general textual patterns, but the most frequent words for any given text in English tend to look very similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Word|Frequency|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|the| 1,160,276|\n",
    "|of|906,898|\n",
    "|and|682,419|\n",
    "|in|461,328|\n",
    "|to|418,017|\n",
    "|a|334,082|\n",
    "|is|214,663|\n",

    "|by|181,605|\n",
    "|as|177,774|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many [function words](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#function-words), words like \"the\", \"in\", and \"of\" that are grammatically important but do not carry as much semantic meaning in comparison to [content words](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#content-words), such as nouns and verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, many analysts remove common [function words](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#function-words) using a [stopwords](https://docs.tdm-pilot.org/key-terms/#stop-words) list. There are many sources for stopwords lists. (We'll use the Natural Language Toolkit stopwords list in this lesson.) **There is no official, standardized stopwords list for text analysis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective stopwords list depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the texts being analyzed\n",
    "* the purpose of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we remove all common function words, there are often formulaic repetitions in texts that may be counter-productive for the research goal.**The researcher is responsible for making educated decisions about whether or not to include any particular stopword given the research context.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples where additional stopwords may be necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A corpus of law books is likely to have formulaic, archaic repetition, such as, \"hereunto this law is enacted...\"\n",
    "* A corpus of dramatic plays is likely to have speech markers for each line, leading to an over-representation of character names (Hamlet, Gertrude, Laertes, etc.)\n",
    "* A corpus of emails is likely to have header language (to, from, cc, bcc), technical language (attached, copied, thread, chain) and salutations (attached, best, dear, cheers, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every research project may require unique stopwords, it is important for researchers to learn to create and modify stopwords lists."
