Complete this notebook if you are familiar with Jupyter Notebooks or have completed the [Introduction to Jupyter notebook](#placeholder), but do not have any experience with Python programming. This is Python programming for absolute beginners and forms the first part of a 3-part series in *Python Basics* that will prepare you to do text analysis using the Python programming language. \n",

    "Python is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning Python is a great choice because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
    "2. Python is widely-regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
    "3. Python is flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n",
    "4. Python is in-demand by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is R. We plan to create additional support for learning R soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for R, please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you'll learn in Python Basics I-III are general-purpose Python skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. After you complete these notebooks, you will be prepared to use, modify, and author notebooks at Level 1 such as:\n",

    "## Making Mistakes is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer at every level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option for **undo** that will undo a change *within a cell*, but there is also an option for **undo cell operation** that can undelete entire cells or other changes that occur at a larger scale than a single cell. To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](#expression) using an [operator](#operator). An [expression](#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The [operator](#operator) in this case is +, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the triangle \"play button\" or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code.\n"

For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an integer while the latter is a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Python can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a string. A string is encapsulated by single or double quotes. A string can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an integer, 5.0 is a float, but '5' and '5.0' are strings. A string can also be blank, such as ''. \n",
