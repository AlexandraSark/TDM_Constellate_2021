In this context, the word \"[unigram](./key-terms.ipynb#unigram)\" describes a single word construction like the word \"chicken.\" There are also [bigrams](./key-terms.ipynb#bigram) (e.g. \"chicken stock\"), [trigrams](./key-terms.ipynb#trigram) (\"homemade chicken stock\"), and [n-grams](./key-terms.ipynb#n-gram) of any length.

Ultimately, we decided to improve the [HathiTrust Extracted Features format](https://worksets.htrc.illinois.edu/context/ef_context.json) to support key features our users sought (for example, the ability to analyze texts at the level of individual journal articles instead of at the issue-level).
