    "# Python Basics II\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python Basics I, you learned about expressions, operators, variables, and a few native Python functions. We wrote programs that executed line-by-line, starting at the top and running to the bottom. This approach works great for simple programs that may execute a few tasks, but as you begin writing programs that can do multiple tasks you'll need a way for your programs to decide which action comes next. We can control when code gets executed with **flow control statements**. If a program is a set of steps for accomplishing a task, then **flow control statements** help the program decide the next action. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow control statements** work like a flowchart. For example, let's say your goal is to hang out and relax with friends. There are a number of steps you might take, depending on whether your friends are available or you feel like making some new friends.\n",

    "Each diamond in our flowchart represents a decision that has to be made about the best step to take next. This is the essence of **flow control statements**. They help a program decide what the next step should be given the current circumstances. "

    "## Boolean Values\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we to create flow control statements is with boolean values that have two possible values: **True** or **False**. In our example above, we could consider a \"Yes\" to be \"True\" and a \"No\" to be \"False.\" When we have the data we need to answer each question, we could store that answer in a variable, like:\n",
